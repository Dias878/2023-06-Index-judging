# Incorrect  fee deduction for buy, during the `_createBidInfo` affects the bidding process. Normal user could not able to place bid with hid in-hand fund

## Summary

Contract has the [_calculateAuctionSizeAndDirection](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L789) fucntion which will be called in [_createBidInfo ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L772C14-L772C28) during the bidding call by the user.

when we look at the function `_calculateAuctionSizeAndDirection`, it deducts the protocol fee when bid is for buy. But the contract has another function [_accrueProtocolFee ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L329) to process the protocol fee at the end of bidding process.

since the fee is deducted before the transaction happens, a valid user who only has certain amount of funds can not bid.

## Vulnerability Detail

lets look at the function call

[bid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L309C14-L309C17) -> create [bid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L323) -> [_calculateAuctionSizeAndDirection](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L789) -> fee [deducted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L924) for buy.

but after the bid creation and completing the transaction successfully, the actual protocol fee is deducted in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L329

so, the protocol fee is deducted prior to arriving the transaction value and transactions. this would make the valid user not able to bid when they have certain amount of fund only.

this will cause hindrance to certain group of people.

## Impact

not able to bid by certain user who only has certain amount of funds. which would be possible by properly deducting the fee.
