# Malicious Actor can grief settoken holders due to no min amount check for component amount

## Summary
A malicious actor can grief settokens holders due to no min check for component amount. A malicious actor can enter 0 and grief users by indirectly calling accrueprotocolfee

## Vulnerability Detail

The function bid allows a user to bid on components through auction.
```solidity
 function bid(
        ISetToken _setToken,
        IERC20 _component,
        uint256 _componentAmount,
        uint256 _quoteAssetLimit
    )
```

However, there is no check in this function nor in its nested function if the _componentAmount is 0. This opens the door for a griefing attack because the function bid also calls the function accrueprotocolfee (an internal function), which pays the settokenmanager settokens by minting and inflating the settoken supply.

So a malicious actor, Alice can call bid with the sole purpose of calling accrueprotocolfee, which steals funds from settoken holders through inflation. This attack can be further amplified with a flash loan as the protocolfee also takes into account the settoken, receivetoken balance shown here:
```solidity
  // Calculate the amount of tokens exchanged during the bid.
        uint256 exchangedQuantity = receiveToken.balanceOf(address(setToken))
            .sub(_bidInfo.preBidTokenReceivedBalance);
        
        // Calculate the protocol fee.
        uint256 protocolFee = getModuleFee(AUCTION_MODULE_V1_PROTOCOL_FEE_INDEX, exchangedQuantity);
```

So Alice can make the attack more potent by sending receivetokens  to the settoken contract through a flash loan to accrue even more fees and inflate the settoken supply even more.



## Impact

User funds will be lost due to a grieving attack by indirectly calling an internal function (accrueprotocolfee). Users can have the value of their settokens diluted through inflation

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a minimum component amount for users to call the function bid in order to increase the price of such an attack
