# Token transfers do not verify that the tokens were successfully transferred.

## Summary
Some ERC20 tokens donâ€™t throw but just return false when a transfer fails. This implies that not all tokens can be used

## Vulnerability Detail
Using `token.transferFrom(msg.sender, addr, amount);`  is NOT enough. The risk is that you're assuming the transfer was successful when actually it wasn't. Example of tokens that don't revert: ZRX, HT, WOO.
Also using `require(token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(0),token amount), "...");`  isn't quite safe. There are indeed some common tokens that aren't ERC20-compliant and don't return true on success. USDT is an example.

## Impact

This can be abused to trick the _executeBid() function to receive the component amount without providing any tokens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The safest method is using this:

```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory data) = address(token).call(abi.encodeWithSelector(token.transferFrom.selector, from, to, value));
require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), 'token transfer from sender failed');
```
