# No revert on Failure on Erc20 Token Transfer

## Summary
The code in the `_executeBid` function lacks proper error handling when invoking the `transferFrom` function. This omission poses a risk as it doesn't validate the success of the token transfer, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_executeBid` function transfers tokens from the `_bidInfo.receiveToken` address to the `msg.sender` and then invokes a transfer from the `SetToken` contract to the `msg.sender`. However, it fails to check the return value of the `transferFrom` function, disregarding any potential transfer failures.
## Impact
If a transfer fails, the code will continue executing, leading to unexpected behavior or loss of funds for the users involved in the bid process.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Utilize the require statement or a similar mechanism, so that the code can validate the success of the transfer and revert the transaction if it fails. Here's an example of how to mitigate the vulnerability:
```solidity
function _executeBid(
    BidInfo memory _bidInfo
)
    internal
{
    // Transfer the received tokens from the sender to the SetToken.
    require(
        transferFrom(
            _bidInfo.receiveToken,
            msg.sender,
            address(_bidInfo.setToken),
            _bidInfo.quantityReceivedBySet
        ),
        "Transfer from sender to SetToken failed"
    );

    // Invoke the transfer of the sent tokens from the SetToken to the sender.
    require(
        _bidInfo.setToken.strictInvokeTransfer(
            address(_bidInfo.sendToken),
            msg.sender,
            _bidInfo.quantitySentBySet
        ),
        "Transfer from SetToken to sender failed"
    );
}

```
