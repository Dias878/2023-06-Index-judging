# Division by Zero Error in Time Bucket Calculation

## Summary
The contract code contains a division by zero error in the calculation of the timeBucket variable, which can lead to unexpected behavior and transaction revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `getPrice` function of the contract, the `timeBucket` is calculated by dividing the `_timeElapsed` by bucketSize as shown below:
```solidity
uint256 timeBucket = _timeElapsed / bucketSize;
```
However, there is no validation to ensure that `bucketSize` is non-zero. If `bucketSize` is zero, the division operation will result in a division by zero error, causing the transaction to revert.
## Impact
Transactions invoking the `getPrice` function with a `bucketSize` of zero will fail and revert, preventing the intended behavior of the contract

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
require(bucketSize > 0, "BoundedStepwiseExponentialPriceAdapter: Invalid bucket size");
```
