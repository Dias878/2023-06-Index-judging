# Rebalance Execution Delay on `unlock` Function

## Summary

The `AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol` contract allows users to initiate rebalancing of a set token by starting an auction and submitting bids. However, there is a vulnerability that can result in a delay in executing the rebalance after the auction has ended. This delay can prevent the rebalance from being completed within the expected timeframe and may cause unexpected behavior for users and the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability lies in the `unlock` function of the `AuctionRebalanceModuleV1` contract. This function is called to unlock the set token after the rebalance has ended. However, the condition for unlocking the set token is not properly enforced, allowing for an early unlock even if the rebalance targets are not fully met. This can lead to an incomplete rebalance and potential inconsistencies in the set token's composition.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that the rebalance process can be prematurely terminated, leaving the set token in an incomplete state. This can result in unexpected behavior for users who rely on the rebalance being executed within the expected timeframe. Additionally, it can introduce inconsistencies in the set token's composition, potentially affecting its performance and stability.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function unlock(ISetToken _setToken) external {
  bool isRebalanceDurationElapsed = _isRebalanceDurationElapsed(_setToken);
  bool canUnlockEarly = _canUnlockEarly(_setToken);

  require(isRebalanceDurationElapsed || canUnlockEarly, "Cannot unlock early unless all targets are met and raiseTargetPercentage is zero");

  if (canUnlockEarly) {
    delete rebalanceInfo[_setToken].rebalanceDuration;
    emit LockedRebalanceEndedEarly(_setToken);
  }

  _setToken.unlock();
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to update the `unlock` function to enforce the condition that the rebalance targets are fully met before allowing an early unlock. This can be done by checking if `_allTargetsMet(_setToken)` returns `true` before allowing an early unlock. Additionally, the condition `rebalanceInfo[_setToken].raiseTargetPercentage == 0` should also be checked to ensure that the raise target percentage is zero before allowing an early unlock.

## Proof of Concept

1. Deploy the `AuctionRebalanceModuleV1` contract on the Ethereum mainnet fork.
2. Start a rebalance by calling the `startRebalance` function with the required parameters.
3. Wait for the rebalance duration to elapse.
4. Call the `unlock` function on the `AuctionRebalanceModuleV1` contract to unlock the set token early, even if the rebalance targets are not fully met and the raise target percentage is not zero.
5. Check the state of the set token and verify that the rebalance was prematurely terminated.
