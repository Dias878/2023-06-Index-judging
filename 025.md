# `SetToken` can be indefinitely locked by `AuctionRebalanceModuleV1`

## Summary
Issuance, redemption, and fee collection of a `SetToken` can indefinitely locked by `AuctionRebalanceModuleV1`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.unlock(...)](https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-protocol/blob/663e64efaa95df2247afa8926d4cfb42948f54fe/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L382-L404) method should allow **anyone** to unlock a previously locked `SetToken` (locked by [AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.startRebalance(...)](https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-protocol/blob/663e64efaa95df2247afa8926d4cfb42948f54fe/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L223-L282) for a rebalance auction) as soon as the rebalance duration has elapsed or early unlock is possible (targets are met) in order to re-enable issuance, redemption, and fee collection of a `SetToken`.  Moreover, it is worth to mention that a `SetToken` can [only be unlocked](https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-protocol/blob/663e64efaa95df2247afa8926d4cfb42948f54fe/contracts/protocol/SetToken.sol#L340-L357) by the `msg.sender` who locked it, i.e. via [AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.unlock(...)](https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-protocol/blob/663e64efaa95df2247afa8926d4cfb42948f54fe/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L382-L404) in this case.  

However, as already shown by an [existing test case](https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-protocol/blob/663e64efaa95df2247afa8926d4cfb42948f54fe/test/protocol/modules/v1/auctionRebalanceModuleV1.spec.ts#L1631-L1658), the [early unlock can be blocked](https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-protocol/blob/663e64efaa95df2247afa8926d4cfb42948f54fe/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L1201) although all targets are met by setting `raiseTargetPercentage > 0` via [AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.setRaiseTargetPercentage(...)](https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-protocol/blob/663e64efaa95df2247afa8926d4cfb42948f54fe/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L406-L428). Furthermore, the rebalance duration can be extended at **any** time by the `SetToken` manager by calling [AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.startRebalance(...)](https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-protocol/blob/663e64efaa95df2247afa8926d4cfb42948f54fe/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L223-L282) again with an unreasonably high rebalance duration (there is no upper limit).  

Anyways, there is an even simpler way to cause DoS on **every** unlock attempt (without even setting `raiseTargetPercentage > 0`) by just setting the [rebalance duration](https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-protocol/blob/663e64efaa95df2247afa8926d4cfb42948f54fe/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L276) to `type(uint256).max` which will cause [AuctionRebalanceModuleV1._isRebalanceDurationElapsed(...)](https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-protocol/blob/663e64efaa95df2247afa8926d4cfb42948f54fe/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L1182-L1191) to revert with *'SafeMath: addition overflow'* on every unlock attempt.

## Impact
Issuance, redemption, and fee collection of a `SetToken` can be indefinitely locked by `AuctionRebalanceModuleV1` by simply blocking or causing DoS of [AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.unlock(...)](https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-protocol/blob/663e64efaa95df2247afa8926d4cfb42948f54fe/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L382-L404).  
This behaviour should not be possible and is not suggested by the [AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.unlock(...)](https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-protocol/blob/663e64efaa95df2247afa8926d4cfb42948f54fe/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L382-L404) method which is accessible by **anyone** and should allow to unlock a `SetToken` at least after a reasonable amount of time.

## Code Snippet
The following PoC modifies existing test cases to demonstrate DoS on **all** unlock attempts. Just apply the *diff* below and run the test with `npx hardhat test test/protocol/modules/v1/auctionRebalanceModuleV1.spec.ts`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enforce a reasonable upper limit on the rebalance duration and only allow a new rebalance auction to be started when the previous one elapsed or has concluded (met targets, early unlock). See issue "New auction rebalance can be started before previous one concluded or duration elapsed".  

Alternative: In case the described behaviour is intended, the `onlyManagerAndValidSet(_setToken)` modifier should be added to the `unlock(...)` method in order to make it clear that the `SetToken` manager is effectively in total control of the lock/unlock mechanism.
