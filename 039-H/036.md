# Price is not calculated correctly according to the documentation in the contract

## Summary
In `BoundedStepwiseExponentialPriceAdapter.sol` contract the returned value of the `getPrice` function does not match the formula in the documentation, which is `price = initialPrice +/- scalingFactor * e ^ (timeCoefficient * timeBucket)`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Below are 2 examples of the calculation issue.

### Example when time elapsed >= bucket size:
- Initial price = 100
- Scaling factor = 1
- Time coefficient = 1
- Is price decreasing = true
- Bucket size = 1 hour (3600)
- Time elapsed = 1 hour (3600)

According to the contract formula, this should be the calculation:
```plaintext
timeBucket = 3600 / 3600 = 1

initialPrice - scalingFactor * e ^ (timeCoefficient * timeBucket) =
= 100 - 1 * e^(1 * 1) =
= 100 - 1 * e^1 =
= 100 - 1 * 2.718281828459045235 =
= 100 - 2.718281828459045235 =
= 97.281718171540954765
```
[Calculation in Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=100+-+1+*+exp%281%29)

But the `getPrice` result with the same parameters is 98.281718171540955000 (`98281718171540955000` in wei)

  ### Test snippet of `getPrice` with the parameters of the example
Add this to `boundedStepwiseExponentialPriceAdapter.spec.ts` test and run `npx hardhat test`
This test should pass, but it fails instead.
  ```js
    it.only("Should return the correct price", async () => {
      subjectInitialPrice = ether(100);
      subjectCoefficient = 1;
      subjectExponent = ether(1);
      subjectBucketSize = ONE_HOUR_IN_SECONDS;
      subjectIsDecreasing = true;
      subjectMaxPrice = ether(100);
      subjectMinPrice = ether(90);
      subjectIncreaseTime = ONE_HOUR_IN_SECONDS;

      const returnedPrice = await subject();

      const expectedPrice = ether("97.281718171540954765"); // 100 - 1 * e^(1 * 1)
      const tolerance = 100;

      expect(returnedPrice).to.be.closeTo(expectedPrice, tolerance); // Returned price is 98.281718171540955000
    });
  ```
</details>

As a result, the calculation in the contract is incorrect by 1 (1e18 wei), which could be impactful for tokens, that have a price closer to 0.

### Example when scaling factor is > 1 and the time elapsed < bucket size:
- Initial price = 100
- Scaling factor = 2
- Time coefficient = 1
- Is price decreasing = true
- Bucket size = 1 hour (3600)
- Time elapsed = 0.5 hours (1800)

According to the formula:
```plaintext
timeBucket = 1800 / 3600 = 0 (Actually 0.5, but because of rounding down in Solidity it is 0)

initialPrice - scalingFactor * e ^ (timeCoefficient * timeBucket) =
= 100 - 2 * e^(1 * 0) =
= 100 - 2 * e^0 =
= 100 - 2 * 1 =
= 100 - 2 = 
= 98
```

But the `getPrice` result with the same parameters is 99 (`99000000000000000000` in wei)

  ### Test snippet of `getPrice` with the parameters of the example
Add this to `boundedStepwiseExponentialPriceAdapter.spec.ts` test and run `npx hardhat test`
Note: in this test, price is expected to match the formula calculation.
  ```js
    it.only("Should return the correct price", async () => {
      subjectInitialPrice = ether(100);
      subjectCoefficient = 2;
      subjectExponent = ether(1);
      subjectBucketSize = ONE_HOUR_IN_SECONDS;
      subjectIsDecreasing = true;
      subjectMaxPrice = ether(100);
      subjectMinPrice = ether(90);
      subjectIncreaseTime = ONE_HOUR_IN_SECONDS.div(2);

      const returnedPrice = await subject();

      const expectedPrice = ether("98"); // 100 - 2 * e^(1 * 0)
      const tolerance = 100;

      expect(returnedPrice).to.be.closeTo(expectedPrice, tolerance); // Returned price is 99
    });
  ```
</details>

As a result, there is one of 2 issues (depending on what Index Protocol expects):
1. If scaling factor > 1 = initial step/bucket will not be the initial price. 
If that is the case, then the calculation is off by 1 (1e18 wei)
2. Calculation should start from the initial price.
If that is the case, then the calculations will always be off by `scaling factory * 1e18 - 1e18` (1e18 wei in this case)

## Impact
Because of the incorrect calculation, there are 2 issues:
1. With the current calculation the price will be +1 (1e18) every time. This means if the price of the token is closer to 0, the incorrect calculation in `getPrice` will have a bigger impact since the calculation will always add 1 to the price.
2. If the `scalingFactor` > 1, then the initial step/bucket will not be the initial price.

## Code Snippet
[`BoundedStepwiseExponentialPriceAdapter.sol L:73`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/integration/auction-price/BoundedStepwiseExponentialPriceAdapter.sol#L73)
```solidity
        uint256 priceChange = scalingFactor * expExpression - WAD;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
My recommendation depends on what Index Protocol wants.
1. If the initial step/bucket should be the initial price, then the `priceChange` should be changed to:
```solidity
uint256 priceChange = expExpression == WAD ? 0 : scalingFactor * expExpression;
```
Explanation:
If `expExpression` is equal to `WAD` (1e18) - it means that the time elapsed is less than the bucket size and the price should not change. 
Else the price should change by `scalingFactor * expExpression`

2. If the calculation should follow the formula, that is in the contract documentation, then the `priceChange` should be changed to:
```solidity
uint256 priceChange = scalingFactor * expExpression;
```
