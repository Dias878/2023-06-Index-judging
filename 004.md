# `scalingFactor` has to be a decimal in Exp/Log price adapters

## Summary
In exponential/logarithmic price adapters, `scalingFactor` is an integer now, but they have to be a decimal with 18 decimals for example.

## Vulnerability Detail
In exponential and logarithmic price adapters, some parameters like `scalingFactor` are introduced to represent various price graph.
For example, price change at time T is represented like `P(T) = F * exp(C*T)`.
However, in the current codebase, `scalingFactor` is an integer so it can't represent decimals like 0.5 or 1.5.

## Impact
If `scalingFactor` is an integer, it can not represent all kinds of exp/log graph that means price change would not be flexible enough.

## Recommendation
Convert `scalingFactor` to have 18 decimals in `BoundedStepwiseExponentialPriceAdapter` and `BoundedStepwiseLogarithmicPriceAdapter`.
