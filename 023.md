# Bidders would not be able to place bids if the setToken is locked by another Module.

## Summary:Rebalance Period would Elapse without bids

## Vulnerability Detail:When starting rebalance() the AuctionRebalanceV1.sol contract doesn't take into consideration if the setToken is being locked by another module and would end up starting a rebalance whereby  bidders would not be able to bid and when a Rebalance is in process and the setToken isn't locked, another module could lock the setToken .The function startRebalance() which is used for initiating a rebalance Auction doesn't take into consideration if a setToken is locked,This would eventually lead to two scenarios
(1):When setTokens is locked and the Manager specifies to startRebalance while locking the setToken this would end up reverting due to the fact that the setToken is locked.
(2):When setToken is locked and the Manager specifies to startRebalance without locking the setToken , this is very problematic because Rebalance  Period would elapse with bidders not be able to place bids till the setToken is unlocked.
when a Rebalance is in process and the setToken isn't locked, another module could lock the setToken which could lead to:
(1) When a rebalance is in the process and the setToken isn't locked,This would mean that another module can lock the setToken , which would result in bidders not able to create bids.
## Impact:When the state of the setToken isn't considered Rebalance Period would elapse with bidders not able to bid.

## Code Snippet: if (_shouldLockSetToken && _setToken.locker() != address(this)) {
            _setToken.lock();
        }
Users would not be able to place bid when setToken is locked due to the fact that setToken would not be able to send tokens to the bidder due to the fact that the module calling Invoke() is not the locker.Detailed execution flow
_executeBid===>_bidInfo.setToken.strictInvokeTransfer(
            address(_bidInfo.sendToken),
            msg.sender,
            _bidInfo.quantitySentBySet===> Invoke.invokeTransfer(_setToken, _token, _to, _quantity);===> _setToken.invoke(_token, 0, callData);

Manual Review

## Recommendation:Additional checks to ensure Rebalance cannot be started unless setToken isn't locked and always lock setToken till Rebalance Period is elapsed.
