# Protocol fees reduce SetToken holders' value AND can be bypassed entirely

## Summary
The `AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol` allows a user to rebalance assets based on pre-defined weights. After the exchange of tokens is made, a protocol fee is deducted **directly from the SetToken contract balance**. Therefore, the user receives the full swap amount without fee deducted, and the current SetToken holders will lose value due to the rebalance.

This also incentivizes SetToken holders to call `BasicIssuanceModule.redeem()` prior to any auction bids. This will redeem their assets at the current value and will avoid exposure to any protocol fees. They are then able to call `BasicIssuanceModule.issue()` to mint their SetTokens again.
