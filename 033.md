# Potential reentrancy Attack Risk in _executeBid Function

## Summary
The `_executeBid` function in the given code implementation poses a risk of a reentrancy attack. This vulnerability arises due to the potential for an external contract called during the token transfers to maliciously invoke a function in the SetToken contract, leading to unintended consequences.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_executeBid` function transfers tokens between the sender and the `SetToken` using the `transferFrom` and `strictInvokeTransfer` functions. However, if any of these token transfer functions trigger an external contract call, there is a risk of a reentrancy attack.
Here's the code snippet of the vulnerable function:
```solidity
function _executeBid(BidInfo memory _bidInfo) internal {
    transferFrom(
        _bidInfo.receiveToken,
        msg.sender,
        address(_bidInfo.setToken),
        _bidInfo.quantityReceivedBySet
    );

    _bidInfo.setToken.strictInvokeTransfer(
        address(_bidInfo.sendToken),
        msg.sender,
        _bidInfo.quantitySentBySet
    );
}

```
The vulnerability lies in the potential interaction between the external contract and the `SetToken` contract during the token transfers. If the external contract invokes a fallback function or a function that triggers another transfer, it can reenter the `_executeBid` function before the previous transfer completes, potentially leading to unintended consequences or financial loss.
## Impact
The impact of a successful reentrancy attack could result in the malicious contract continuously reentering the `_executeBid` function, causing unexpected behavior, loss of funds, or even contract manipulation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
function _executeBid(BidInfo memory _bidInfo) internal {
    // Transfer the received tokens from the sender to the SetToken.
    IERC20(_bidInfo.receiveToken).transferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(_bidInfo.setToken),
        _bidInfo.quantityReceivedBySet
    );

    // Update state after token transfer but before any external call
    // to prevent potential reentrancy attacks.

    // Invoke the transfer of the sent tokens from the SetToken to the sender.
    _bidInfo.setToken.strictInvokeTransfer(
        address(_bidInfo.sendToken),
        msg.sender,
        _bidInfo.quantitySentBySet
    );
}

```
Ensure that all state changes are completed before any external interaction. This approach reduces the vulnerability to reentrancy attacks, as the critical state changes are completed upfront, and subsequent external calls cannot manipulate the state during the same execution context.
