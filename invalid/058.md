# The normalized target unit can be set to zero

## Summary
The _getNormalizedTargetUnit function doesnâ€™t check for a zero target unit.
## Vulnerability Detail
If the _getNormalizedTargetUnit function is used to calculate a position's target unit in a rebalance, and the target unit is set to zero, it will  result in division by zero or incorrect position calculations.
## Impact
It will cause issues when calculating quantities, determining auction sizes and directions, or checking if rebalance targets are met potentially resulting in loss of funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A check should be added to the _getNormalizedTargetUnit function to ensure that the target unit is not set to zero.
