# Precision Loss in `getPrice` Function

## Summary
The `getPrice` function in the provided code snippet contains an order of operations issue that can lead to precision loss. The problem arises from the sequence of division and multiplication operations used in the calculation, which can result in inaccurate values due to truncation.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
uint256 bucket = _timeElapsed / bucketSize;
uint256 priceChange = bucket * slope;
```
The `bucket` variable is calculated by dividing `_timeElapsed` by `bucketSize`, which performs an integer division operation in Solidity. If there is a remainder from the division, it is truncated, potentially leading to precision loss.
Subsequently, the `priceChange` variable is calculated by multiplying `bucket` with `slope`. However, since bucket may have undergone truncation, the multiplication can introduce further precision loss.
## Impact
Inaccurate price calculations in the `getPrice` function.
