# Tokens with fee on transfer are not supported in AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol

## Summary
Some tokens require a transfer fee and this if not properly implemented can lead to incorrect balances within the setToken

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens take a transfer fee (e.g. STA, PAXG), some do not currently charge a fee but may do so in the future (e.g. USDT, USDC). In the current implementation, it is assumed that the received amount is the same as the transfer amount. However, due to how fee-on-transfer tokens work, much less will be received than what was transferred.

## Impact
i.e. Fee-on-transfer scenario:
Contract calls transfer from contractA 100 tokens to current contract
Current contract thinks it received 100 tokens
It updates balances to increase +100 tokens
While actually contract received only 90 tokens
That breaks whole math for given token

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider comparing before and after balance to get the actual transferred amount. Alternatively, disallow tokens with fee-on-transfer mechanics to be added as tokens.
