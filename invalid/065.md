# The approximately equal range is too high for some high-value tokens.

## Summary

The approximately equal range is too high for some high-value tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail

`approximatelyEquals` checks whether the auction target value equals the current value. It takes an approximate approach; about +-1  deviation is accepted. For some high-value tokens,  take wBtc for example; the deviation may be too high. It can cause all targets to be met very early, which leads to the bidder can call `raiseAssetTargets`  even target not meet.  

## Impact
` positionMultiplier`  could reach a very high value

## Recommendation
