# Manger has no way to disable target raises after enabling them

## Summary

Managers can enable target raises but have no way to ever disable them, which can lead to unexpected and unwanted target increases. 

## Vulnerability Detail

[AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L413-L428](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L413-L428)

    function setRaiseTargetPercentage(
        ISetToken _setToken,
        uint256 _raiseTargetPercentage
    )
        external
        onlyManagerAndValidSet(_setToken)
    {
        // Ensure the raise target percentage is greater than 0
        require(_raiseTargetPercentage > 0, "Target percentage must be greater than 0");

        // Update the raise target percentage in the RebalanceInfo struct
        rebalanceInfo[_setToken].raiseTargetPercentage = _raiseTargetPercentage;

        // Emit an event to log the updated raise target percentage
        emit RaiseTargetPercentageUpdated(_setToken, _raiseTargetPercentage);
    }

AuctionRebalanceModuleV1#setRaiseTargetPercentage allows the manager to set raiseTargetPercentage but after it has been enabled it can never be turned back off. This can lead to unexpected/malicious target increases. It also leads to excessive lock times because set tokens with a non-zero raiseTargetPercentage can never be unlocked early. The only way to reverse it after enabling it would be to remove the module then re-enabling it. This is considered dangerous according to comments throughout the code since there are many factors to consider

## Impact

Target raises cannot be disabled once enabled
