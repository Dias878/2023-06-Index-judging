# Target raises can be highly damaging for dutch auctions with multiple components

## Summary

Multi-component dutch auctions are fundamentally incompatible with target raises and will lead to inefficient pricing causing loss to set token.

## Vulnerability Detail

The AuctionRebalanceModuleV1 allows targets to be increased when all component targets have been met and there is still excess quote token. When combined with multiple components, it his highly likely that these target raises will lead to inefficient pricing which will cause loss to the set token.

Consider the following a set token has the following composition that has target raises enabled:

40% USDC
30% WBTC
30% WETH

The manager wishes to rebalance the set to the following using USDC as the quote token:

20% USDC
40% WBTC
40% WETH

Assume the WETH portion of the execute within the first hour of the auction. The WBTC on the other hand doesn't execute until 12 hours in. Assume there is excess quote so the target is increased. The issue is that now because of the change in time, the WETH auction is now well above the market price. This buys the WETH for a large loss compared to the market price of WETH.

## Impact

Pricing after target raises will likely be heavily skewed from market prices for some components lead to set token losses

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Target raises should reset `rebalanceStartTime` allowing the dutch auction to restart and properly price the assets
