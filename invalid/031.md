# calculation for timeBucket in getPrice() could result in zero due to rounding down.

## Summary
possible rounding to zero when calculating timeBucket in getPrice() functions found in all  bounded stepwise price adapters.

## Vulnerability Detail
considering that `bucketSize` is "Time elapsed between each bucket" and `_timeElapsed` is "Time elapsed since the start of the auction".

There is a possibility of rounding down to zero since  _timeElasped, can be a smaller value than bucketSize..

Especially when the getPrice() function is called and the auction just freshly started.

This exists in all bounded stepwise price adapters

## Impact
calculation for timeBucket could result in zero due to rounding down.

## Tool used

Lofi radio and Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe change timeBucket from uint256 to int256, tbh i don't know if this will help tho.
