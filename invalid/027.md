# User could suffer loss if quote asset changes before their bid is mined

## Summary
Set token manager could call startRebalance and change quoteAsset between when a user initiates a bid transaction and when that bid transaction is mined. And this could have a devastating effect on users.

## Vulnerability Detail
### POC
* A user places a bid to buy 5 TOK for 1000 USDC
* The setToken manager sees this and frontrun the user to startRebalance with WETH but still maintain price
* The bid transaction is mined and confirms that user gets the expected 5 TOK, but he paid 1000 WETH which is thousands of times more valuable than the USDC he thought he was paying


## Impact
User lose funds cause they pay with a different quote asset than expected, and the new quote asset and amount could be more valuable.

Accept quoteAsset as parameter in bid and validate against rebalanceInfo.quoteAsset.
