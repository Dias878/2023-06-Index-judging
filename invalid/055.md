# Imbalance between the excess quote asset and the components being purchased in the raiseAssetTargets() function

## Summary
The raiseAssetTargets() function increases the target units for all components uniformly. However, there is no verification to ensure that the increase in target units does not result in an imbalance between the excess quote asset and the components being purchased
## Vulnerability Detail
In the raiseAssetTargets() function, the target units for all components are uniformly increased without considering the balance of the quote asset and the components. This means that if the increase in target units is significant and the quote asset balance is not sufficient to cover the purchase of the components, the rebalancing operation will result in an imbalance.
For example, if the target units for all components are increased by a large percentage, but the quote asset balance is relatively small, it may not be possible to purchase the required amount of components without exceeding the quote asset balance. This can lead to an undesired allocation where some components are purchased while others are not, causing an imbalance in the portfolio.
## Impact
This lead to an incorrect rebalance and expose the system to vulnerabilities such as price manipulation or incorrect allocation and loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate the excess quote asset balance by subtracting the normalized target unit from the current position unit of the quote asset and then multiplying it by the total supply of the SetToken. Then calculate the maximum quote asset balance that can be used without exceeding the excess by dividing the excess quote balance by the new position multiplier and then dividing it by the precise unit. Finally, verify if the maximum quote balance is greater than or equal to zero to ensure that the increase in target units will not result in an excessive amount of quote asset being used
