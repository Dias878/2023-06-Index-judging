# Auctions for same `setToken` can be created during an auction

## Summary
Auctions for `setToken` can be created during an auction, overwriting current auction data.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `startRebalance` function in `AuctionRebalanceModuleV1`, it does not check if the auction is expired or can be ended early.
Thus, it will overwrite current auction data which will break previous auction.

## Impact
1. It will create unclear timeline for rebalancing mechanism.
2. It will lead to unexpected bids when there are pending bid transactions in the mempool that are submitted before new rebalance started.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a validation line for checking if the auction is expired or all components met conditions.
