# Malicious actors can DoS users, that want to buy all / most of the remaining quantity of a component, by frontrunning them with dust amount bids

## Summary

When users place bids that are very close, or equal to the maximum available amount for that particular component, malicious users can frontrun them with a small bid for the same asset, in turn, making their transaction revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

Lets take the following example:

There is a currently ongoing auction and one of the components that it sells is WETH. The currently available quantity for that component is **10**. 

Alice sees that this auction, and since she is really bullish on WETH, she decides to buy all of the available quantity from the auction. We can then observe the following flow of actions: 

1. Alice places a bid for buying **10 WETH**
2. Unfortunately for her, Bob has been carefully monitoring the mempool for such transactions, and when he sees her transaction, he simply places his own one with a  slightly higher gas price, where he places a bid for buying **1 wei of WETH**
3. The transaction of Bob gets executed.
4. The transaction of Alice gets executed. It will however revert on this [require statement](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/8d348ed344635a068d458aa04956f966b6d3d4f3/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L796), since now the available quantity of WETH is **10 WETH - 1 wei**

The above scenario can repeat itself a few times, until Alice either buys an amount significantly lower the the one she initially anticipated, or she simply gives up on participating in the auction entirely.


## Impact

The following negative impacts can be observed: 

1. Bids that are very close, or equal to the maximum available quantity for that particular component have a high probability of being reverted, in turn, disincentivizing users from placing such ones
2. Users will be able to buy components at lower prices (when their price adapters are configured to decrease the price over time)
3. The time for reaching the targets of all components may be artificially prolonged

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, you can either:

1. Add a configurable minimum bid amount, and check that the [_componentAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/8d348ed344635a068d458aa04956f966b6d3d4f3/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L312) is greater than or equal to it at the start of each bid
2. When the available auction quantity for that particular component is less than the requested component amount, simply sell the available amount to the user, instead of reverting. If you go this route, you may also want to consider adding a function parameter, that lets users specify exactly how much less they are willing to buy.
