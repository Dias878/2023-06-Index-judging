# All of the price adapters rely on time fixed price, vulnerable to rapid market changes.

## Summary
All of the prices for the components are set at the beginning of an auction and if the price of the asset changes in the time-span of the execution of the auction users will be able to bid on behalf of the protocol. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Due to the nature of how prices for components are set some auctions will be extremely profitable for users while others won't end because users will lose money if they execute bids.

Scenario: 
- Auction is set to re-balance to **2000USDC : 1 WETH**, with 100 WETH as quantity and given 1 week time. In the set time WETH price is exactly 2000$, and it's ratio is 1:1 
- 5 days later WETH price increases to **2200$**. Now users will be incentivized to trade, since the calculation for WETH's price is constant or even slowly decreasing (if the owner  choose the [stepwiseAddapters](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/tree/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/integration/auction-price) ), this may be good in one hand since the auction is gonna be quick auction, but on the other, the protocol is trading on bad prices.

Now instead of 100 WETH (or what's left of the 100 WETH after the 5th day) making 220 000USDC it will make only 
200 000USDC, which is not bad, but it's still a missed income.

As we can see below in [startRebalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L241-L282) `_newComponentsAuctionParams` && `_oldComponentsAuctionParams` are where prices are stored.

```jsx
    struct AuctionExecutionParams {
        uint256 targetUnit;
        string priceAdapterName; 
        bytes priceAdapterConfigData;// Encoded data for configuring the chosen price adapter.
    }
    function startRebalance(
        ISetToken _setToken,
        IERC20 _quoteAsset,
        address[] calldata _newComponents,
//Prices are set at the start of the auction
        AuctionExecutionParams[] memory _newComponentsAuctionParams,
        AuctionExecutionParams[] memory _oldComponentsAuctionParams,
        ...
    )
```
And then when a [bid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L309-L348) is made, in it's [_createBidInfo](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L772-L836) the prices are extracted and calculated, giving `componentPrice`, **which is as old as the action.**
```jsx
        bidInfo.componentPrice = bidInfo.priceAdapter.getPrice(
            address(_setToken),
            address(_component),
            _componentQuantity,
            block.timestamp.sub(rebalanceInfo[_setToken].rebalanceStartTime),
            rebalanceInfo[_setToken].rebalanceDuration,
//This is from where the price comes, but it is set only in the beginning of the auction
            bidInfo.priceAdapterConfigData
        );
```

## Impact
User may face outdated prices when trading, leading to bad trades for the protocol or unfinished auction.
