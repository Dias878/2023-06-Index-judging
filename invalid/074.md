# transfer() can fail silently, buyer does not receive send token.

## Summary

`_executeBid()` uses `strictInvokeTransfer()` with uses a standard `transfer()` to transfer the send token to the bidder. If this is done on a token that fails silently the bid could be completed without the bidder receiving a token.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `_executeBid()` 

```solidity
        _bidInfo.setToken.strictInvokeTransfer(
            address(_bidInfo.sendToken),
            msg.sender,
            _bidInfo.quantitySentBySet
        )
```

where 

```solidity
bytes memory callData = abi.encodeWithSignature("transfer(address,uint256)", _to, _quantity);
```
is used to invoke a call from the SetToken. This could fail silently and as a result the bidder does not receive the tokens that they paid for.

## Impact

A bidder could complete a bid and pay without receiving the component/quoteAsset they should due to a silent failure off a `transfer()` call.

Use `SafeTransfer()` from a audited library such as OpenZeppelin.
