# `getPrice` in `BoundedStepwiseExponentialPriceAdapter.sol` can silently fail because of unintentional overflow

## Summary
The function `getPrice` is used in `AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol` to calculate the component price in a bid and this function has several overflow checks, which will make it return a value every time, but it can still silently overflow and revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `getPrice` checks first if the multiplication of exponential arguments `timeBucket` and `timeCoefficient` will overflow, as can be seen here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/integration/auction-price/BoundedStepwiseExponentialPriceAdapter.sol#L58 and if that is not the case it will multiply those exponential arguments and then cast it into a int256 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/integration/auction-price/BoundedStepwiseExponentialPriceAdapter.sol#L61
The problem relies on the fact that normal casting it into a int256 can be dangerous, since the multiplication can be less than `type(uint256).max` but greater than `type(int256).max` which will make the casting overflow into a very low value. If the value of the multiplication will be greater with then `type(int256).max` with even one the casting will be overflow and instead of the expected value, it will get to  `type(int256).min`. The problem occurs because the next if statement will not pass https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/integration/auction-price/BoundedStepwiseExponentialPriceAdapter.sol#L64-L66
and the value is then passed into `FixedPointMathLib.expWad` function https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/integration/auction-price/BoundedStepwiseExponentialPriceAdapter.sol#L67 but this function will revert all the time if the value of the integer provided is less than $-42139678854452767551$ as can be seen in the code https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/a549dab581488018fbd334871f99bb9170a2fdb9/src/utils/FixedPointMathLib.sol#L125C1-L125C1 which means that in many cases this function will revert. 
## Impact
The impact is a medium one since it can affect the whole pricing logic of the protocol, in those cases

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since you check for overflows, I recommend in the first if statement to check 
```solidity
if (timeBucket > type(int256).max / timeCoefficient) {
```
instead of 
```solidity
if (timeBucket > type(uint256).max / timeCoefficient) {
```
since that way you will be protected also from the silent overflows of casting and the whole price logic would not revert.
