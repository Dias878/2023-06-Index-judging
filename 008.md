# potential overflow during the multiplication of `bucket` and `slope`

## Summary
- problem in `getPrice` function, specifically in the calculation of the `priceChange` variable , causes potential overflow during the multiplication of `bucket` and `slope.` Since the bucket value is derived from the _timeElapsed input parameter, an attacker could provide a large value for _timeElapsed, causing an arithmetic overflow when multiplying it by slope.
This overflow can result in an incorrect priceChange value, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security risks
## Vulnerability Detail
See the summary 
## Impact
- set a large value for slope and _timeElapsed to trigger the overflow during the multiplication of bucket and slope.
An example : 
```solidity
slope = 2**256 - 1;  // Large slope value
_timeElapsed = 2**256 - 1;  // Large time elapsed value
bucketSize = 1;  // Arbitrary bucket size
```
- the calculation ` bucket = _timeElapsed / bucketSize ` will result in a large value for bucket. Then, during the multiplication ` priceChange = bucket * slope, ` an arithmetic overflow will occur due to the large values of bucket and slope.
So at the end the result of this overflow will lead to an incorrect value for priceChange, and  affecting the calculated price and causing unexpected behavior within the contract.

## Recommendation
Adding proper input validation and bounds checking when performing arithmetic operations that involve user-supplied values, Implementing checks to ensure the input values are within acceptable ranges will help prevent arithmetic overflow.
