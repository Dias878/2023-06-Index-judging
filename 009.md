# Early unlock will not work forever once `raiseTargetPercentage` is set by a manager in auction rebalance module

## Summary
Early unlock will not work forever once `raiseTargetPercentage` is set by a manager.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `unlock` function, it provides a feature to early unlock the `setToken` when all conditions are met before the auction ends.
One of conditions is that `raiseTargetPercentage` must be zero.
The `raiseTargetPercentage` is set by a manager in `setRaiseTargetPercentage` function, but it requires the `raiseTargetPercentage` to be greater than zero, which means it can not be set back to zero.
As long as `raiseTargetPercentage` remains positive, early unlock functionality will not work.

## Impact
Early unlock feature won't be working forever.
