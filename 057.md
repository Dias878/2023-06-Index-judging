# Malicious users can exploit the auction and make profit when the SetToken is not locked.

## Summary

The SetToken can be minted and redeemed by anyone when it is not locked during rebalancing. This can allow malicious users to front-run and back-run the bidders and manipulate the auction outcome.

## Vulnerability Detail

When rebalancing, the token manager can configure if the SetToken is locked or not. If the SetToken is not locked, anyone can mint and redeem the SetToken using BasicIssuanceModule. The token manager can also configure the pricing mechanism via the priceAdapter. There are some mechanisms:
- ConstantPriceAdapter: the price is fixed - similar to place limit orders.
- BoundedStepWise adapters: like Dutch Auction which the price can increase/decrease over time.

Let's see an example: 

The current price of WETH is 1940 USDC.
Total supply of the SetToken is 10.

A Set Token with component WETH and current unit(1 WETH) wants to achieve target unit (0.5 WETH - 975 USDC).
- Current unit: 1 WETH => Current notional: 10 WETH
- Target unint: 0.5 WETH - 975 USDC => Target notional: (5 WETH - 9750 USDC)

To achieve this, it needs to sell WETH to buy USDC. The manager starts rebalancing using linear price curve: start at $2000, lower to minimum $1900, take steps of $0.1 every minute. It also chooses USDC as the quote token.

Assuming when the price of WETH reaches 1950 USDC, a bidder bids for all of the available WETH for the rebalance process, which is 0.5 WETH per Set Token or 5 WETH in total for 9750 USDC (5*1950). The expected result should be that the SetToken will meet the target and the rebalancing process will finish. The end position will be:

- Expected position: 0.5 WETH - 975 USDC => Expected notional (5 WETH - 9750 USDC)

However, the module is deployed on mainnet and polygon, a malicious user can front-run the bidder and mint the SetToken to make profit and disrupt the auction. The malicious user mints 10 SetToken using 10 WETH. It increases the total supply of the SetToken to 20.

- After the malicious user front-run the bidder: 
    - Current unit: 1 WETH => Current notional: 20 WETH.
    - Target unit: 0.5 WETH - 975 USDC => Target notional: (10 WETH - 19500 USDC)
- After bidder bids 5 WETH for 9750 USDC:
    - Current: 0.75 WETH - 487.5 USDC => Current notional: (15 WETH - 9750 USDC)

After that, the malicious user can back-run the bidding transaction and redeem his 10 SetToken for 7.5 ETH and 4875 USDC. Malicious user balance:

- Before: 10 WETH = 19400 USDC
- After: 7.5 WETH + 4875 USDC = 7.5 * 1940 + 4875 = 19425 USDC.

The malicious user can make a profit of 25 USDC and disrupt the auction because the auction cannot finish as it should be.

He cannot make a profit directly by bidding because the bidder may need to be whitelisted by the manager.

In conclusion, if the price of auction is above the market price and a bid is placed, a malicious user can front-run and back-run the bidder and make a profit and disrupt the auction in the unlocked rebalancing process.

## Impact

The malicious user can make a profit and prevent the auction from meeting the target and finishing.

## Recommendation

The SetToken should be always locked when rebalancing.
