# Lack of an expiry can result in loss of user funds through MEV

## Summary
A lack of an expiry could result in a loss of user funds through MEV

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/AuctionRebalanceModuleV1.sol#L309-L314

The function bid lacks a parameter to let bids expire after a certain time has passed. This is dangerous. On many chains, transactions can be held by validators, prompting a MEV sandwich attack, where a malicious validator can front run a bidder by calling issue in the settoken contract, hold the bidder's transaction, and then calling redeem after the bidder calls the function bid.  Depending on the adapter settings, users would be left vulnerable to significant price swings, resulting in an unexpected loss of funds where quoteassetlimit parameter will not be sufficient as slippage protection. 

## Impact
Users could lose funds due to a lack of an expiry in the bid function
