# issue does not allow user to specify the input acceptable for each component in BasicIssuanceModule

## Summary
issue does not allow user to specify the maximum input for each component in BasicIssuanceModule

## Vulnerability Detail
`issue` is the interface where user acquire the setToken token, by allowing it to pull each component token from the user in order to mint the specified `_quantity`; before that the user needs to approve the required amount for transferFrom. 

The actual conversion rate, or quantity required from the user, is calculated on real-time, by `getRequiredComponentUnitsForIssue`, which computes based on the componet's positionRealUnit at the time of issuance. This is a floating variable and subject to the performance of the underlying index strategy.

However there is no way for the user to specify the maximum amount acceptable on each component that he/she is willing to spend. If the user is not aware, or over-approve the module before calling `issue`; then the user could be caught off-guard by the actual spent amount.

```solidity
    function issue(
        ISetToken _setToken,
        uint256 _quantity,
        address _to
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyValidAndInitializedSet(_setToken)
    {
        require(_quantity > 0, "Issue quantity must be > 0");

        address hookContract = _callPreIssueHooks(_setToken, _quantity, msg.sender, _to);

        (
            address[] memory components,
            uint256[] memory componentQuantities
        ) = getRequiredComponentUnitsForIssue(_setToken, _quantity);

        // For each position, transfer the required underlying to the SetToken
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < components.length; i++) {
            // Transfer the component to the SetToken
            transferFrom(
                IERC20(components[i]),
                msg.sender,
                address(_setToken),
                componentQuantities[i]
            );
        }

        // Mint the SetToken
        _setToken.mint(_to, _quantity);

        emit SetTokenIssued(address(_setToken), msg.sender, _to, hookContract, _quantity);
    }
```

The same case for redeem applies, which works the other way around where output minimum is not specified

## Impact
no slippage protection for user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
allow user to specify each maximum input for component during issue.
