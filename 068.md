# Potential price manipulation during bid creation and execution in SetToken rebalancing

## Summary
A potential vulnerability in the bid creation mechanism of the contract allows an attacker to manipulate prices of underlying assets to exploit arbitrage opportunities. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the bid price is determined at the time of bid creation and does not reflect the current price at the time of bid execution.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the bidding process, the price for the assets is determined at the point the bid is created. If an attacker is capable of manipulating the price of the quote asset or other components of the SetToken between the time of bid creation and bid execution, a discrepancy can be created between the execution price and the initial bid price.

## Impact
This vulnerability could lead to an economic advantage for an attacker who successfully exploits the price discrepancy. Users could face an economic disadvantage as they may end up paying more for the assets than their current market value at the time of bid execution. Furthermore, the normal functioning of the auction process could be disrupted, leading to a skewed distribution of assets in the SetToken.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Bob could potentially execute the following steps to exploit this vulnerability:

1. Bob monitors the bids created by Alice.
2. Once Alice creates a bid, Bob takes note of the assets involved in the bid and the price at which Alice created the bid.
3. Bob then interacts with the market to manipulate the price of the quote asset or the other components of the SetToken that Alice is bidding on. This could be achieved by buying or selling large quantities of the asset.
4. Once the price has significantly changed, Bob can now buy the SetToken at the new inflated or deflated price.
5. Bob redeems the SetToken for the underlying assets. If the attack is successful, Bob will receive more of the asset that he initially manipulated, realizing a profit.

To address this issue, the contract should recalculate and validate the quote asset quantity at the time of bid execution. This would ensure that the bid uses the most current and accurate price. It's also recommended to introduce safeguards to prevent drastic price manipulation of the underlying assets. For instance, using a price oracle could provide more accurate and tamper-proof pricing information.
